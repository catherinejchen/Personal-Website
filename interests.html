                    things within my lifetime. As expected, some of these passions were
                    short and some were long. Here, I'll be talking about four of my
                    biggest passions that are still prevelent to this day. Let's get started!!

                            At the age of five, I began learning piano. Honestly, I can’t say
                            I remember much other than the fact that there were many times when
                            I didn’t feel like practicing, annoyed by how slowly I was
                            improving and how repetitive practicing was. I would complain about
                            this and my parents would ask me if I wanted to quit. Every time,
                            this question would immediately quiet me because I refused to not
                            be able to reach a certain speed or evoke a certain emotion or
                            achieve a certain sense of clarity or so on. Before I knew it, I
                            found myself looking forward to the challenge of being able to
                            overcome these struggles. I started setting more goals and I became
                            more passionate about music. I began to try more
                            instruments on my own time, in school and in cadet band such as the
                            violin, flute, alto saxophone and ukulele.

                                At the Tom Lee Centre in Vancouver of 2014??, I
                                played my heart out in front of two examiners in a one-hour
                                performance. Despite my stage fright, I enjoyed the feeling of being
                                able to demonstrate all the hard work I have put into practicing
                                within the ten years prior. Through all the tears and smiles, and the
                                failures and successes, I was able to come out and put on a show;
                                thus, earning my Associate Diploma of Music in Piano Performance.

                        I’ve been playing video games for as long as I can remember. From faithfully feeding my Tamagotchi four times a day to
                        playing League of Legends, I’ve always loved being able to immerse myself in a different world. Along the way, I began
                        to ask questions. How was it made? How was it being run? As I grew older, the characters, stories and dynamics of
                        computer games, and the conversations with engineering professionals sparked my fascination and grew into a desire to
                        experiment with coding on my own and __.

                        Favourite Memory: One of my favourite memories is actually how I started playing League of Legends. __ smth about only
                        playing non pc games___. Probably an unorthodox scenario, I happened to bring my laptop over to a sleepover. My friend,
                        an avid gamer, decided to download League on my laptop and before I knew it, I was trying out something new!

                        Lessons:
                        <br>- You can never be certain of an outcome. Even if it seems like you are losing, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have
                        a perfect next fight that can change the entire game (and vice versa).
                        <br>- Communication and trust will make or break a team. Even with the best individual players, without these
                        foundations, the team will not be the best.
                        <br>- It’s important to just have fun and rewind because balance is extremely important!</p>

                        Lessons:
                        <br>- You never know when opportunities might come knocking on your door so it’s important to be prepared for when it
                        does come around.
                        <br>- Everyone is on their own journey at their own pace. Some people may have started earlier but that doesn’t mean
                        you won’t get their yourself.
