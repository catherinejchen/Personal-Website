                                amount of work and effort placed into this was unlike any other. Prior to this,

                            At the age of five, I began learning piano. Honestly, I can’t say
                            I remember much other than the fact that there were many times when
                            I didn’t feel like practicing, annoyed by how slowly I was
                            improving and how repetitive practicing was. I would complain about
                            this and my parents would ask me if I wanted to quit. Every time,
                            this question would immediately quiet me because I refused to not
                            be able to reach a certain speed or evoke a certain emotion or
                            achieve a certain sense of clarity or so on. Before I knew it, I
                            found myself looking forward to the challenge of being able to
                            overcome these struggles. I started setting more goals and I became
                            more passionate about music. I began to try more
                            instruments on my own time, in school and in cadet band such as the
                            violin, flute, alto saxophone and ukulele.

                                At the Tom Lee Centre in Vancouver of 2014??, I
                                played my heart out in front of two examiners in a one-hour
                                performance. Despite my stage fright, I enjoyed the feeling of being
                                able to demonstrate all the hard work I have put into practicing
                                within the ten years prior. Through all the tears and smiles, and the
                                failures and successes, I was able to come out and put on a show;
                                thus, earning my Associate Diploma of Music in Piano Performance.

                            playing League of Legends, I’ve always loved being able to
                            immerse myself in a different world. Along the way, I began
                            to ask questions. How was it made? How was it being run? As
                            I grew older, the characters, stories and dynamics of
                            computer games, and the conversations with engineering
                            professionals sparked my fascination and grew into a desire
                            to experiment with coding on my own and __.

                                an unorthodox scenario, I happened to bring my laptop over to a
                                sleepover. My friend, an avid gamer, decided to download League on my
                                laptop and before I knew it, I was trying out something new! Who knew

                            At the age of five, I began learning piano. Honestly, I can’t say
                            I remember much other than the fact that there were many times when
                            I didn’t feel like practicing, annoyed by how slowly I was
                            improving and how repetitive practicing was. I would complain about
                            this and my parents would ask me if I wanted to quit. Every time,
                            this question would immediately quiet me because I refused to not
                            be able to reach a certain speed or evoke a certain emotion or
                            achieve a certain sense of clarity or so on. Before I knew it, I
                            found myself looking forward to the challenge of being able to
                            overcome these struggles. I started setting more goals and I became
                            more passionate about music. I began to try more
                            instruments on my own time, in school and in cadet band such as the
                            violin, flute, alto saxophone and ukulele.

                                At the Tom Lee Centre in Vancouver of 2014??, I
                                played my heart out in front of two examiners in a one-hour
                                performance. Despite my stage fright, I enjoyed the feeling of being
                                able to demonstrate all the hard work I have put into practicing
                                within the ten years prior. Through all the tears and smiles, and the
                                failures and successes, I was able to come out and put on a show;
                                thus, earning my Associate Diploma of Music in Piano Performance.
