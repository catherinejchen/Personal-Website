                <p> Hi!! I'm Catherine - an inventive, passionate, persistent and versatile individual~ â™¡<br><br>
                    Born and raised in Vancouver, BC, I am now pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering
                    at the University of Waterloo.
                    <br><br>
                    From a young age my curious and inquisitive nature pushed me to explore how everything in the
                    world functions. Eventually, this expanded into taking specific classes, joining school clubs and
                    participating in non profits outside of school. From these, I have developed core competencies,
                    improved technological skills and most importantly, gained lifelong lessons.
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time you can find me at my pc (which I built) editing videos, drawing digitally or
                    playing video games, or you can find me around campus participating in club activities or social
                    gatherings. Feel free to check out my projects and experiences!! :))</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    - My main goal in life would be to create a positive impact on as many individuals as possible.</li>
                    <br>
                    - I hope to own a cat and a dog one day.
                    <br>
                    - My favourite number is 9.
                    <br>
                    - I enjoy playing sports for fun such as basketball, badminton and volleyball. Ironically,
                      my jersey number was always 2 (not 9).
                    <br>
                    - My dream destinations include French Polynesia, New Zealand and Singapore. Places I'd love
                      to go back to are California and Hawaii.
                    <br>
                    - I love eating strawberries.
                    <br>
                    - I've played piano since I was 5 and picked up other instruments in the mean time
                      including violin, alto saxophone, flute and more.
                    <br>
